    "In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.\n",

    "The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.\n",

    "We have overhauled the problem description + test cases and specified clearly the graph is an undirected graph. For the directed graph follow up please see Redundant Connection II). We apologize for any inconvenience caused."
